Developed using Processing 0134.
Requires the oscP5 library.

The AtomSwarm_G tab contains a great deal of performance-specific
code, and should simply be used as an example application of this
framework.

The following tabs contain documented and reusable code:
 - Atom
 - AtomClasses
 - AtomConstants
 - AtomGenConst
 - AtomGenetic
 - AtomSwarm
 - drawing, spec, util (helper functions)

Agents can be selected with the mouse, which displays their current
metabolic state.

Keyboard commands:
-------------------
a	- Create AtomGenetic agent
A	- Destroy random AtomGenetic agent
'	- Scatter swarm
\	- Unify swarm
space	- Pause/unpause
+	- Cause currently selected agent to reproduce
